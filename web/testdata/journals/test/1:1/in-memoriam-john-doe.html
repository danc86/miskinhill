<p>Boris Christa was born in Sofia to a Bulgarian father and a British 
mother, but left the country of his birth for good when only a few months old. 
His early childhood was spent in Stuttgart, where his maternal grandfather had 
taught English for many years, and where his mother found employment as 
a secretary at the British consulate. In 1937, she moved with her two youngest 
children to England, and Boris was sent at the age of 12 as a boarder to 
Wynstones, a Rudolf Steiner school in the environs of Gloucester. In 1944, his 
plans to study medicine at London University were set aside when he was called 
up for military service and selected for officer training. He was commissioned 
a lieutenant on the eve of VE day and, thanks to his fluency in German, was 
posted to the garrison of a camp for prisoners of war. It was at the suggestion 
of his commanding officer that he applied to the Inter-Services Russian Course, 
set up to equip suitable officers with the language skills necessary for 
liaison work with the Soviet Army in occupied Germany. After graduation he was 
despatched to Berlin, and soon afterwards was attached as British liaison 
officer and interpreter to the Soviet military mission at Bad Salzuflen. The 
eighteen months he spent travelling in the suite of General Konovalov provided 
the material for many famous Christa anecdotes in later years.</p>
