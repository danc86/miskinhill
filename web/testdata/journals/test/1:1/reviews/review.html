<p>This book, the first in a series on Soviet and Post-Soviet politics and 
society, comprises fifteen papers, most of which were presented at the 
conference named in the subtitle. With the exception of three essays in English 
(by Arnold, Burkov and Hussner), the volume, including an Introduction and 
forward-looking Conclusion by Andreas Umland and Oksana Stuppo, is in Russian. 
Yekaterinburg was pointedly selected as the conference venue for its reputation 
as a centre of juridical education and research, the relative political 
diversity of the Sverdlovsk region and because Russia’s main centres are not 
representative of the state of affairs in the regions (17). The conference 
was envisaged as a ‘progress report on the implementation of the ECHR in 
Russia’ (219), three years after its ratification by the Russian Parliament 
in 1998. It was planned in the spirit of optimism and brought together such 
diverse constituencies as academics in law and social sciences, government 
officials, human rights activists and former dissidents. The crackdown on 
independent media in 2001 by the new Putin administration, however, made for 
divisiveness among the participants over a topical human rights issue – freedom 
of speech.</p>
