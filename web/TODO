* MARC crap:
    - get a copy of AACR2 and make sure we adhere to it (then adjust 
      MARC leader to say so)
    - convert ISO language codes to MARC language codes (sigh)
    - non-filing chars in titles!!!
    - LCSH -- really wish lcsh.info hadn't been taken down :-(
    - other subjects/classification? NLA has Dewey
    - corporate name added entries for ANZSA etc? -- NLA has this
    - personal name added entries for editors? -- NLA doesn't have 
      this (also should it be per issue rather than on the journal 
      maybe?)
    - MARC at the issue level also? need to find out how libraries handle this 
      (can holdings be represented in MARC? does e.g. INNOPAC support importing 
      holdings?)
    - MARC at article level??? nobody will want this though I suspect ..
* implement COINS in citation-openurl.js: http://ocoins.info/
* BibTeX citations
* js for footnotes
* article subjects from SLCCS ASEES index page

eventually:
* get into Goog Scholar, UQ catalogue, UQ's III federated search thingy?
