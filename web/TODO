* feedback links on everything
* author details: all known works, links to wikipedia(/freebase/etc?)

soonish:
* write automated MODS checker:
  http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/display/DLFAquifer/MODS+Guidelines+Levels+of+Adoption
  and assert our level of compliance for all live records (in the same vein as webtest.sh)

once we have more than one issue:
* author index per journal
* index (cloud? experiment with sensible presentation of hierarchy) of subjects 
  per issue(?), per journal, and global

eventually:
* search
    - limit to journal/issue
* get into Goog Scholar, UQ catalogue, UQ's III federated search thingy?
* online ordering of back issues
* subjects:
    - show in issue contents?
    - link subjects to ll01.nla.gov.au search, also user's library? 
      somewhere else good?
    - go all web-2.0 and have tags/keywords/something? (any good LT 
      tags? somewhere else?)
    - come up with something better? 
      http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/23
* MARC crap:
    - get a copy of AACR2 and make sure we adhere to it (then adjust 
      MARC leader to say so)
    - non-filing chars in titles!!!
    - LCSH -- really wish lcsh.info hadn't been taken down :-(
    - other subjects/classification? NLA has Dewey
    - corporate name added entries for ANZSA etc? -- NLA has this
    - personal name added entries for editors? -- NLA doesn't have 
      this (also should it be per issue rather than on the journal 
      maybe?)
    - MARC at the issue level also? need to find out how libraries handle this 
      (can holdings be represented in MARC? does e.g. INNOPAC support importing 
      holdings?)
    - MARC at article level??? nobody will want this though I suspect ..
