<h3>Our work</h3>

<p><a href="/journals/asees/">Australian Slavonic and East European 
Studies</a> is a scholarly journal which publishes articles and book reviews 
in the area of Slavonic and East European studies. The journalâ€™s content 
poses a number of technical challenges, due to the regular appearance of 
articles which use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, as well as phonetic 
notation.</p>
<p>The <a href="/journals/asees/">online edition</a> of <em>ASEES</em> was prepared from source 
material by Miskin Hill Academic Publishing, and is hosted on this site. We 
have also provided technical assistance with the preparation of the print 
edition of several recent volumes.</p>
