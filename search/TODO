* relevance bar instead of raw floats
* index authors and reviews (and anything else?)
* show something better than just URIs in results (dc:title for articles, 
  foaf:name for authors, ..)
* distinguish results by type (which types are most important? can this be dynamic?)

* for the future:
    - Cyrillic transliteration: probably easiest to try mapping latin back to
      cyrillic in a few different ways (rather than cyrillic back to latin in all 
      the various possible ways?)
    - prime for soft signs in names: does it get tokenized out? do we end up with a
      sensible phrase query anyway? this might be good enough already
