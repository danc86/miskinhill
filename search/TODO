- Cyrillic transliteration: probably easiest to try mapping latin back to
  cyrillic in a few different ways (rather than cyrillic back to latin in all 
  the various possible ways?)
- prime for soft signs in names: does it get tokenized out? do we end up with a
  sensible phrase query anyway? this might be good enough already
